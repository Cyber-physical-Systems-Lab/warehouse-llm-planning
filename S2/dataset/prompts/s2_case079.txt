Task: Sequential cooperative task: RobotA first moves the red box from Shelf.red.slot to RedBin.slot, then RobotB moves the blue box from Shelf.blue.slot to BlueBin.slot.

Two robots (robotA and robotB) operate in a small warehouse.
The objective is:
- robotA moves the redbox from Shelf.red.slot to RedBin.slot.
- After robotA has finished its part, robotB moves the bluebox from Shelf.blue.slot to BlueBin.slot.

Both robots act independently, but robotB must only start after robotA is done.

Environment symbols:
- Objects: redbox, bluebox
- Slots: Shelf.red.slot, Shelf.blue.slot, RedBin.slot, BlueBin.slot
- Poses/docks: Shelf.front.dock, RedBin.dock, BlueBin.dock

Available high-level actions (you MUST only use these):
- base.goto(target)
- arm.pick(object, from)
- arm.place(object, to)

Action step formats (examples with placeholders):
- {"agent": "<agent_name>", "action": "base.goto", "target": "<pose_name>"}
- {"agent": "<agent_name>", "action": "arm.pick", "object": "<object_name>", "from": "<slot_name>"}
- {"agent": "<agent_name>", "action": "arm.place", "object": "<object_name>", "to": "<slot_name>"}
where <agent_name> is either "robotA" or "robotB".

Output format (STRICT JSON):
- You MUST output ONLY a single JSON object with the structure:
  {"steps": [ STEP_1, STEP_2, ... ]}
- Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or extra text.
- Use only the given agents, actions, objects, slots, and poses.
