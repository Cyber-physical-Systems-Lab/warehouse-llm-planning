Task: Four robots perform cooperative handover tasks. RobotA & RobotC handle the red box; RobotB & RobotD handle the blue box. The current sequence is A-first, meaning which relay chain initiates first.

RobotA picks up the red box from Shelf.red.slot and places it at Inspection.slot.
RobotC waits until the red box is available at Inspection.slot, then moves it to RedBin.slot.

RobotB picks up the blue box from Shelf.blue.slot and places it at Inspection.slot.
RobotD waits until the blue box is available at Inspection.slot, then moves it to BlueBin.slot.

Ensure that only one box occupies the Inspection.slot at any time.

Generate a valid plan in strict JSON format. The plan should include a list of steps like:
{ "steps": [ {"agent": "robotA", "action": "base.goto", "target": "Shelf.front.dock"} ] }
Only include valid actions defined in the environment (base.goto, arm.pick, arm.place, wait_until_free).
