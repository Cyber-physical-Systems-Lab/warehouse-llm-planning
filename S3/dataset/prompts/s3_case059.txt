Task: Two robots (robotA, robotB) must each move their own box through a shared inspection area.

High-level objective:
- robotA moves redbox from Shelf.red.slot to RedBin.slot.
- robotB moves bluebox from Shelf.blue.slot to BlueBin.slot.
- Both boxes must pass through the shared Inspection.slot on the way to their bins.

Shared resource:
- Inspection.slot is a single shared slot.
- Only one box can occupy Inspection.slot at any time (mutual exclusion).

Environment symbols:
- Objects: redbox, bluebox
- Slots: Shelf.red.slot, Shelf.blue.slot, Inspection.slot, RedBin.slot, BlueBin.slot
- Poses/docks: Shelf.front.dock, Inspection.dock, RedBin.dock, BlueBin.dock

Coordination rules (MUST follow):
1) Each robot must first pick up its own box from the shelf
   (robotA from Shelf.red.slot, robotB from Shelf.blue.slot)
   before any robot moves a box from Inspection.slot to its bin.
2) Before any robot places INTO Inspection.slot, it MUST issue
   a wait step that checks the slot is free, immediately before
   that place step.
3) The plan should show overlapping activity: do NOT make one robot
   finish its entire flow before the other even starts. Their
   actions should be interleaved in time.
4) Use exactly these names for slots and bins:
   Shelf.red.slot, Shelf.blue.slot, Inspection.slot, RedBin.slot, BlueBin.slot.
5) Every step MUST include the "agent" field.

In this scenario, robotB is expected to be the first robot that
successfully uses the shared Inspection.slot, while robotA uses
it later, after coordination.

Available high-level actions (JSON steps only):
- base.goto
- arm.pick
- arm.place
- wait_until_free

Action formats (you MUST only use these JSON shapes):
- {"agent": "<agent_name>",
   "action": "base.goto",
   "target": "<PoseName>"}
- {"agent": "<agent_name>",
   "action": "arm.pick",
   "object": "<Obj>",
   "from": "<SlotName>"}
- {"agent": "<agent_name>",
   "action": "arm.place",
   "object": "<Obj>",
   "to": "<SlotName>"}
- {"agent": "<agent_name>",
   "action": "wait_until_free",
   "target": "Inspection.slot"}

Output format (STRICT JSON):
- Return ONLY a single JSON object with a single key "steps":
  {"steps": [ STEP_1, STEP_2, ... ]}
- Do NOT include any extra text, comments, or code fences.
- Use only the given agents, actions, objects, slots, and poses.
