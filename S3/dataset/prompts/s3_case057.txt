Task: Both robots must transport their boxes via the Inspection area before final placement. The current order is B-first.

RobotA moves the red box from Shelf.red.slot to RedBin.slot via Inspection.slot.
RobotB moves the blue box from Shelf.blue.slot to BlueBin.slot via Inspection.slot.

Constraints:
- Only one box can occupy the Inspection.slot at any time.
- Each robot must perform a full pick–inspect–place sequence.
- Ensure proper synchronization and mutual exclusion when accessing Inspection.slot.

Generate a valid plan in strict JSON format. The plan should include a list of steps like:
{ "steps": [ {"agent": "robotA", "action": "base.goto", "target": "Shelf.front.dock"} ] }
Only include valid actions defined in the environment (base.goto, arm.pick, arm.place, wait_until_free).
